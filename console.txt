After running the ./console.py(program) this is the errors I get:

./console.py:76: SyntaxWarning: "is" with a literal. Did you mean "=="?

-----
code is generating SyntaxWarnings related to the use of the is operator with literals. The warnings suggest using == instead of is when comparing literals.

# Here's an example of the warning in your code:

pyCode:
if pline[0] is '{' and pline[-1] is'}':
This line is checking if the first and last characters of pline are the literals '{' and '}'. To address the warning, you can use == instead of is:

pyCode:
if pline[0] == '{' and pline[-1] == '}':
Repeat this adjustment in other similar lines where you encounter the same warning. The is operator is generally used for identity comparison, while == is used for equality comparison, which is more appropriate when comparing values.

Here are the specific lines in your code that are generating the SyntaxWarning related to the use of is with literals:

Line 76:
	pyCode:
		if pline[0] is '{' and pline[-1] is'}':

Line 76 (appears to be a duplicate of the first occurrence):
	pyCode:
	if pline[0] is '{' and pline[-1] is'}':

Line 275:
	pyCcode:
		if args and args[0] is '\"':  # check for quoted arg

Line 283:
	pyCode:
		if not att_name and args[0] is not ' ':

Line 286:
	pyCode:
		if args[2] and args[2][0] is '\"':

In each of these lines, replace is with == for comparing literals.
