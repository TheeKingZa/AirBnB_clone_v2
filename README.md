# AirBnB Clone v2
# [Authors](https://github.com/TheeKingZa/AirBnB_clone_v2/blob/master/AUTHORS) 

# Description

    This project is an implementation of a simplified version of AirBnB's backend system. It includes a command-line interpreter and a storage engine for managing data related to AirBnB-like objects.

# **Background Context**
Environment variables will be your best friend for this project!

* HBNB_ENV: running environment. It can be “dev” or “test” for the moment (“production” soon!)
* HBNB_MYSQL_USER: the username of your MySQL
* HBNB_MYSQL_PWD: the password of your MySQL
* HBNB_MYSQL_HOST: the hostname of your MySQL
* HBNB_MYSQL_DB: the database name of your MySQL
* HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE: the type of storage used. It can be “file” (using FileStorage) or db (using DBStorage)

## Unit Testing
    Unit testing is a software testing method in which individual units or components of a program are tested in isolation to ensure that they function correctly. The primary goal of unit testing is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. In a large project, unit testing becomes crucial for maintaining code quality, catching bugs early in the development process, and facilitating code refactoring.

Why Unit Testing?
	1. Early Detection of Bugs: Unit tests help identify and fix bugs at an early stage, preventing them from escalating into larger issues.

	2. Code Refactoring: Unit tests provide a safety net for making changes to the codebase. Developers can confidently refactor code knowing that existing functionality won't break.

	3. Documentation: Unit tests serve as living documentation, showcasing how each component of the system is intended to work.

	4. Continuous Integration: Automated unit tests are integral to continuous integration pipelines, ensuring that new code changes do not introduce regressions.

How to Implement Unit Testing in a Large Project
	1. Choose a Testing Framework:
Select a testing framework that fits your project and programming language. Popular choices include unittest for Python, JUnit for Java, and JUnit for JavaScript.

	2. Organize Your Project Structure:
Arrange your project in a way that facilitates easy testing. Place your unit tests in a separate directory, and structure your code to be modular and testable.

	3. Write Testable Code:
Design your code with testability in mind. Break down complex functions into smaller, testable units. Use dependency injection to make it easier to isolate and test components.

	4. Write Unit Tests:
Create individual test cases for each unit or component. Test a unit's inputs, outputs, and edge cases. Ensure that the tests cover a broad spectrum of scenarios.

		Example (using Python's unittest):

		pyCode
		import unittest
		from your_module import your_function

class TestYourFunction(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_positive_input(self):
        self.assertEqual(your_function(2, 3), 5)

    def test_negative_input(self):
        self.assertEqual(your_function(-2, 3), 1)

    # Add more test cases as needed
Automate Testing:
Integrate your unit tests into your continuous integration pipeline. This ensures that tests are run automatically whenever there's a code change, providing rapid feedback.

Maintain and Update Tests:
Regularly review and update your unit tests as the codebase evolves. Ensure that new features and changes are accompanied by corresponding test cases.

By incorporating unit testing into your development workflow, you can enhance the reliability, maintainability, and scalability of your large projects
